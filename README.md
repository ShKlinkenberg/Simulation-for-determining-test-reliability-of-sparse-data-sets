# Simulation for determining test reliability of sparse data sets

This script simulates binary responses to K items for N subjects. To run the simulation do the following.

## Step 1

Instaal the latest version of [R](http://cran.r-project.org).

## Step 2

Run simulation.r. You can change paramaters if you want and also run different scenario's in regard to item bank size, number of subjects or sampled items.

This generates a results.xlsx file with all variables for each scenario.

## Step 3

Run visualisations.r to generate a graph for a single scenario.
